<h2>About Us</h2>

<p>OpenSecure.org is a FREE service started on 01 Oct 2011 that allows users to scan a website address to determine whether it is making malicious connections to potentially damaging websites on the Internet or whether it contains malicious code.</p>

   <div style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; background: #f0f7fc; border: 1px solid #e0eaf0; padding: 15px; text-align: center;">Note: Even if a site shows up as benign from one scan, it is NOT guaranteed that the website is safe to visit.</div>
